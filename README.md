Working with a project:

  1. Click [here](https://casualjackie.github.io/StarNavi/) for open project

  2. Select mode (square size)

  3. Hover over a square to record its coordinates in history

P.S.
  I know that a cycle in a cycle is bad for performance. But in this test with small field size, it fits well. But I have other options, how can I solve it without two cycles.
